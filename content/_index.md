Hi there! I'm Joonas, a passionate multi-disciplinary freelancer from Finland.

I started my work career in the software industry in 2004, and had my own consulting company Jawsy Solutions during 2009-2013.\
I'm currently freelancing as a hands-on software/firmware/hardware/gateware consultant via my own company [Merulogic Oy](https://www.merulogic.com). \
I studied at Aalto University and have a B.Sc degree in Bioinformation Technology and a M.Sc degree in Computer Science.

My current interests include:

* Rust
* Game Boy emulators and hardware analysis
* FPGA/CPLD systems (with Bluespec BSV, or VHDL)
* Digital electronics and circuit boards (with KiCad)
