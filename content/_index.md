Hi there! I'm Joonas, a passionate software developer from Finland.\
I'm a senior software dev during the day, hardware researcher and emulator
developer in the evening, Game Boy specialist 24/7.

I've worked in the IT industry since 2004, and had my own IT consulting company
Jawsy Solutions during 2009-2013.\
I've used Java since 2000, Scala since 2007, and Rust since 2014.\
I'm currently employed by [Reaktor](https://www.reaktor.com).\
I studied at Aalto University and have a B.Sc degree in Bioinformation
Technology and a M.Sc degree in Computer Science.

My current interests include:

* Rust
* Game Boy emulators and hardware analysis
* FPGA/CPLD systems (with VHDL)
* Digital electronics
